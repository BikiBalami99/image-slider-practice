      "My understanding of technologies used in Frontend comes from many online courses. Although I have been coding since I was small, I upgraded my coding knowledge from a beginner to Intermediate through these courses. Currently, I am able to make a fully functioning FrontEnd using these technologies. My understanding of these technologies are getting deeper everyday as I am also slowly seeing the top of the mountain I need to reach. I am not a professional yet, but that is my goal.",
